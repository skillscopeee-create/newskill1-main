# TODO List for Integrating YouTube Data API

- [x] Install axios for API calls.
- [x] Create a YouTube service file to fetch videos based on query.
- [x] Update pages/Results.tsx to use fetched YouTube data instead of dummyData, with sorting by views then likes.
- [x] Test the integration by running the app and searching for a query.
